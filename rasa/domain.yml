  utter_faq/what_is_test_automation:
  - text: test automation is the use of software separate from the software being
      tested to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes
      with predicted outcomes.[1] Test automation can automate some repetitive but
      necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or perform
      additional testing that would be difficult to do manually. Test automation is
      critical for continuous delivery and continuous testing.
  utter_faq/different_types:
  - text: 'There are many approaches to test automation, however below are the general
      approaches used widely: - Graphical user interface testing. A testing framework
      that generates user interface events such as keystrokes and mouse clicks, and
      observes the changes that result in the user interface, to validate that the
      observable behavior of the program is correct. - API driven testing. A testing
      framework that uses a programming interface to the application to validate the
      behaviour under test. Typically API driven testing bypasses application user
      interface altogether. It can also be testing public (usually) interfaces to
      classes, modules or libraries are tested with a variety of input arguments to
      validate that the results that are returned are correct.'
